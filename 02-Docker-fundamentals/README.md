## What problems we have with Traditional Infra?
## Traditional Approach

1. **Installation & Configuration**
- Time consuming
- Need to perform install/configs on every server and every environment (dev, qa, staging, production)
2. **Compatibility & Dependency**
- Need to keep resolving issues related to libraries and
dependencies
3. **Inconsistencies across Environments**
- Very hard to track changes across Dev/QA/Staging and Prod environments and they end up with inconsistencies
4. **Operational Support**
- Need more resources to handle operational issues on day to day basis
    - Server Support (hardware, software)
    - Patching releases
5. **Developer Environments**
- â€¢ When a new developer joins the team, time it takes to provision his development environment in traditional approach is time taking.
