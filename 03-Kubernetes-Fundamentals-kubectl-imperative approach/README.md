# Understand Kubernetes Architecture
- So Kubernetes is a portable, extensible,open source platform for managing container workloads.
    - out of the box the following features are available in Kubernetes.

        - automatic bin packing, 
        - self-healing,
        - secrets and configuration management.

Whether it is master or worker nodes,

container runtime is mandatory
